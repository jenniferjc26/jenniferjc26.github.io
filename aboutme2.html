    <p>As a child when it comes to your career it's a lot to think about. It’s very important because it’s what makes your future. As for me future career path i’d like to follow is law or graphic design /  video editing. I’ve still haven’t fully decided what kind of lawyer to be. My other option would be in the graphic design or editing field,like video editing. My plan to achieve these careers is, to become a lawyer I want to start reading books on how to become one, I need to study everything there's to know about law for example look into some law schools. When it comes to graphic design I've made some of my own designs on my own and I also took a class in my 9th grade year to improve myself, I still photoshop to this day even if it just for fun. Becoming a lawyer would give me an opportunity to help someone and in the graphic design field I’ve had experience with it in the past.As a child when it comes to your career it's a lot to think about.

I still haven’t fully decided what kind of lawyer I would want to be. My other option would be in the graphic design or editing field,like video editing. If I want to into the law field steps to becoming a lawyer would be to look at the kind I would fit into and do more research on it, I would need to study everything there's to know about law for example look into some law schools. When it comes to graphic design I've made some of my own designs on my own and I also took a class in my 9th grade year to improve myself, I still photoshop to this day even if it just for fun. Either of these jobs would interest me if I become a lawyer would give me an opportunity to help someone and in the graphic design field It would be an opportunity to do some designs for companies or for an organization.

<p>Throughout my life I’m experienced some moments where I would have to be a risk taker, there are moments where I would have to be outgoing. Moments where I would be helpful to someone in need of it. When I had to be a risk taker it wasn’t a huge moment but it was when I went camping and there was a rock climbing and a “leap of faith” they aren’t huge risk but they are something that I wouldn’t normally do on a daily which was something I’m proud I did. Moments where I’m an extrovert is very tough for me because I’m not an outgoing person but I try my hardest to be. I try to interact with people I don’t normally would. Moments where I can be helpful towards others is almost everyday if they have a problem with anything and have no one to talk to I’m the person to come to. I’ve helped many people with any issues the best I can.
</p>
<p>Some of these traits also allowed me to achieve some things during my first year of high school.I've participated in my schools play. I also have gotten high honor roll around 3 times. In my 9th grade high school year I took honors geometry. I also was in Drama club and Yearbook and those helped me connect with people i didn't know or talked to. Therefore my time throughout high school so far has been like a rollercoaster there are many ups and downs but with some people by my side it’s easier. Thank you for taking time to read and hope you enjoy the rest of my website.
